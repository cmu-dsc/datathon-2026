## Key Observations

### Top Performers (Improved Crises)
1. **Gambia (GMB002)** - Score: 93.3
   - Improvement Rate: 0.0500/month (severity decreased from 1.7 to 1.4)
   - Duration: 6 months
   - Funding: $5.0M

2. **Mongolia (MNG002)** - Score: 91.9
   - Improvement Rate: 0.1000/month (severity decreased from 2.6 to 2.4)
   - Duration: 2 months (fast improvement)
   - Funding: $27.3M

3. **Papua New Guinea (PNG001)** - Score: 88.1
   - Improvement Rate: 0.1000/month (severity decreased from 2.3 to 2.1)
   - Duration: 2 months (fast improvement)
   - Funding: $0.0M (no funding data)

4. **Timor Leste (TLS002)** - Score: 84.2

   - Duration: 3 months
   - Funding: $0.0M (no funding data)

5. **Tonga (TON002)** - Score: 74.8
   - Improvement Rate: 0.0091/month (severity decreased from 1.3 to 1.2)
   - Duration: 11 months (longer-term improvement)
   - Funding: $12.0M

### Crises with No Change (Still High Scores)
Crises ranked 6-10 all show **no change** in severity but still score highly (72-73) due to:
- High consistency scores (stable severity)
- Good cost-effectiveness (normalized scores around 0.67)
- With new weights (70/20/10), these score lower than before, but consistency still helps

## Impact of Weight Changes

**Before (50/30/20):**
- Crises that worsened but were consistent could score ~51/100
- Crises with no change but perfect consistency could score ~65/100

**After (70/20/10):**
- Crises that worsened are now more heavily penalized
- Crises that improved are now more heavily rewarded
- Top 5 all show actual improvement (vs. some "no change" crises in top 10 before)

## Component Contributions (New Weights)
- **Improvement Rate**: 68.0% of total score (was 46.7%)
- **Consistency**: 22.5% of total score (was 34.5%)
- **Cost-Effectiveness**: 9.5% of total score (was 18.9%)

The new weights successfully emphasize actual improvement over consistency and cost-efficiency.
